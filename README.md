# Bristol Yoga Flow

This was my first attempt at a responsive website using flexbox. The main challenge was having a fixed navigation bar, whilst
scrolling to the correct window location on clicking each section. I achieved this using empty span elements with negative margins.
I later added a slide show using javascript and some css animations/transitions.
